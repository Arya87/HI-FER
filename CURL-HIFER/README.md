#CURL with Human-Inspired Frequent Experience Replay
This repository is the official implementation of CURL-HIFER for the DeepMind control experiments which is based on [CURL](https://mishalaskin.github.io/curl/).

## Installation 

All of the dependencies are in the `conda_env.yml` file. They can be installed manually or with the following command:

```
conda env create -f conda_env.yml
```

## Instructions
You can use the ''execute.py' to train the CURL-HIFER.
```
python execete.py
```

In your console, you should see printouts that look like:

```
| train | E: 221 | S: 28000 | D: 18.1 s | R: 785.2634 | BR: 3.8815 | A_LOSS: -305.7328 | CR_LOSS: 190.9854 | CU_LOSS: 0.0000
| train | E: 225 | S: 28500 | D: 18.6 s | R: 832.4937 | BR: 3.9644 | A_LOSS: -308.7789 | CR_LOSS: 126.0638 | CU_LOSS: 0.0000
| train | E: 229 | S: 29000 | D: 18.8 s | R: 683.6702 | BR: 3.7384 | A_LOSS: -311.3941 | CR_LOSS: 140.2573 | CU_LOSS: 0.0000
| train | E: 233 | S: 29500 | D: 19.6 s | R: 838.0947 | BR: 3.7254 | A_LOSS: -316.9415 | CR_LOSS: 136.5304 | CU_LOSS: 0.0000
```


Log abbreviation mapping:

```
train - training episode
E - total number of episodes 
S - total number of environment steps
D - duration in seconds to train 1 episode
R - mean episode reward
BR - average reward of sampled batch
A_LOSS - average loss of actor
CR_LOSS - average loss of critic
CU_LOSS - average loss of the CURL encoder
```

All data related to the run is stored in the specified `working_dir`. To enable model or video saving, use the `--save_model` or `--save_video` flags. For all available flags, inspect `train.py`. To visualize progress with tensorboard run:

```
tensorboard --logdir log --port 6006
```

and go to `localhost:6006` in your browser. If you're running headlessly, try port forwarding with ssh. 

For GPU accelerated rendering, make sure EGL is installed on your machine and set `export MUJOCO_GL=egl`. For environment troubleshooting issues, see the DeepMind control documentation.
